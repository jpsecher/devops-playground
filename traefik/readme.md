# Træfik with certificates.

## Plan 

- [ ] Deploy a Docker host on AWS.
- [ ] Get Træfik running in a container so that its adm interface can be reached through http.
- [ ] Get a dummy container running in several instances so it can be demonstrated that Træfik load balances between the containers.
