# Playground for DevOps technology

Each branch in this repo carries an experiment with one or more specific technologies.  For instance, the *traefik-lets-encrypt* branch holds experiments with getting Tr√¶fik set up to work as a reverse proxy with certificates from Let's Encrypt.

Each branch is merged (squashed) back onto *master* when the experiment is over.  The result can be inspected in a directory with the same name as the branch.

The *foundation* directory sets up infrastructure common to all experiments.

## Setup
